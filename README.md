**NB** This theme is in beta. Please open an issue on Github if you have problems, or send an e-mail to hello@vhbelvadi.com or @vhbelvadi@historians.social on Mastodon.

### Tips

1. Please turn off `Settings → Appearance → Translucent window` while using this theme.
2. For best results, quit and reopen Obsidian after applying this theme.
